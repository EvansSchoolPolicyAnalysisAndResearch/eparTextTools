Authors@R: c(person("Ryan", "Scott", email = "ryscott5@uw.edu",role = c("aut", "cre")),

Description: This tookit provides a set of resources for analyzing textual documents using the R programming language for the conduct of portfolio analysis and review. The tools rely on text mining, natural language processing, and machine learning programs developed by other R users and as such heavily relies on code developed by other packages. Thus, it may be thought of as a set of tools enabling portfolio analysis rather than a new package for conduct of text analysis
